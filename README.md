# How to use?
Sidera is simple and intuitive to use, with almost no learning curve. We only need to switch between two modes in the bottom bar and use different mouse or touch screen operations to start sorting out the context.
## Default Mode
First, let me explain the two modes and their functions. The default mode allows for simple previewing and basic editing. For previewing, we can use the mouse wheel or two fingers to freely zoom in and out. We can also drag an empty area to move the image. We can also click on a node and drag it to interact. These operations are familiar and simple to modern humans. Next, we'll focus on downloading. Basic editing is very simple. Just remember "double-click it." Double-clicking an empty area creates a new node. Double-clicking a node allows you to edit basic properties, such as the title, inserting an image link, inserting a hyperlink, assigning a tag, and assigning a color. Double-clicking a line segment allows you to edit the directional relationship between the two nodes at the end of the line segment. That's it! It's almost foolproof.
## Linking Mode
Linking mode allows us to focus on editing relationships. Clicking a node establishes the starting point of a new line. Clicking another node establishes a connection. Right-clicking an empty area and dragging over it will cut the line segment (on touchscreens, long-press an empty area). To avoid redundant information, I've added a more focused editing method than the default mode. Double-clicking a node becomes an anchor point, fixing its position, and highlighting the connected line segment. Hovering your mouse over a line segment displays its complete directional relationship. Double-clicking allows editing, which is very helpful when sorting out complex relationships. These two modes can be switched using the "A" and "D" shortcut keys. Using the "Shift" key, we can pin nodes and define the graph. These keys are similar to those you use in games and can be operated with one hand.
## shortcut keys
The two modes mentioned above can be switched using the shortcut keys "A" and "D." Using the "Shift" key, we can fix nodes and finalize the graph. These keys are very similar to those you use in regular games and can be operated with one hand.
